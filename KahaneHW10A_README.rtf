\f0\fs24 \cf0 I mistook the first assignment to mean that we should optimize it to allow for more particles, so the first attempt in this folder was a sad attempt at using FBOs incorrectly. My framerate on the project before my attempt at optimizing was around 30fps, and after my attempt, it was 1fps and glitchy. But I liked some of the screenshots I got out of it and put them in an images folder. You can see the outline of my face in the particles if you look really hard. Anyways, after that I took and old project and used FBOs to display more particles than there actually was. I still had the glitch problem though with the background. \

For the second assignment, I added the delta time stuff to my vector field project (a gui to change the timeScale variable, and added the ability to save frames by pressing s)}
